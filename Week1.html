  <h3>Information Technology (IT) </h3>



  <p>

    Web development is very interesting because you are able to control every little detail, and make the site look however you feel is best.
	We use countless websites each day, so it will be very educational to see the "behind the scenes" of what all needs to be done in order for a site to look clean, serve a purpose, and easy to use.

  <h4>What I Would Like to Learn </h4>

  <ul>

    <li>Responsive Design. I want to learn how to not only make the website, but also using proper layouts
	so people using their phones can access the site with no issues.</li>

    <li>CSS layout and styling</li>

    <li>Fundamentals of JavaScript, since that is still a fairly new language to me</li>

  </ul>
